//
// The RATCHET set for the workflow-mode UI-CURATION system — the face analog of
// STRICT_DOCS ($lib/docs/strict-docs). A module type in this set has been
// PROMOTED to the full curation bar: its co-located `face` MUST be COMPLETE —
// every param, every declared control family, and every numbered-legend control
// appears in `face.order` (the deny-missing-curation guarantee at the control
// surface), enforced by module-face-lint.test.ts.
//
// Modules NOT in this set are checked only for CONSISTENCY (no orphaned face
// keys) — they degrade gracefully while the ratchet rolls out. The set only
// grows:
//  - every NEW faced module ships into it,
//  - a module incidentally reskinned for a fix is brought up + added (boy-scout),
//  - background batches promote the tail.
//
// P1 BATCH 1 (2026-07-25): the first faced-module wave — six total reworks to
// the gallery spec (see .myrobots/plans, workflow-mode UI refactor §3.6 + §5).
// Each entry below carries a complete co-located `face` (order + pages + glyph)
// authored against its fullcard mock.
//
// P1 BATCH 2 (2026-07-26): the second wave — the two pitched voices (dx7,
// sixstrum), the two percussion voices (snaredrum, tomtom) and the two
// processors (shimmershine, qbrt). Same bar: a complete co-located `face`
// (order + pages + glyph + `rear`), authored from what each module ACTUALLY
// is rather than transcribed from its legacy card. The two pitched voices are
// additionally enrolled in default-pitch-accuracy (unit + e2e).
//
// P1 BATCH 3 (2026-07-26): the third wave — the plucked-string voice (karplus)
// and the four workhorse processors/utilities (filter, mixer, delay, reverb) a
// rack reaches for on every patch. Same bar: a complete co-located `face`
// (order + pages + glyph + `rear`).
//
// FACE BATCH B+ (2026-08-02): ringback — the first module PROMOTED from having
// no face at all in this wave (the batch-B reworks all rewrote existing ones).
// It ships the same bar plus the two things batch B established: the ranges
// live in ONE model module the def AND the card import
// ($lib/audio/ringback-crush-model), and its `glyph`/`order` are checked
// against measurements taken from the real DSP core rather than argued in a
// comment.
//
// FACE BATCH 3 (2026-08-03): the PF-20 wave — clap, drummergirl and
// pentemelodica, plus a RE-DO of sixstrum's shipped face. Faceplates authored
// against what each module IS rather than against its legacy card, each with a
// hero, a declared sidebar and DERIVED readouts registered in
// face-readout-values.ts (never a knob relabelled), negative-controlled
// PERMANENTLY in a per-module `*-face-model.test.ts`.
//
// sixstrum is a RE-DO rather than a promotion, and it is the entry that fixes a
// live defect: its shipped face ranked three next-STRIKE-only controls into the
// lane and had no strike key at all, so under `?shell=1` the dock offered
// twenty controls over an instrument that could not be sounded.
//
// FACE BATCH 3 · analogVco (2026-08-08) — the RECOVERY of the face that batch 3
// authored, verified and then dropped. Every unit gate passed at the time; the
// blocker was purely the pixel lane, and it is now fixed rather than deferred.
//
// THE BLOCKER, AND WHAT CLOSED IT. Unlike every other faced module, analogVco
// is a FREE-RUNNING oscillator, so the live `scope` glyph on its COMPACT lane
// tile draws a genuinely moving saw where every other face draws a flat
// centreline (measured 254 / 154 / 315 px across three consecutive captures of
// one tile — the scene simply is not pixel-deterministic). Its DOCK scene was
// always stable, which confirmed the diagnosis rather than contradicting it: a
// `hero.cell` suppresses the glyph there, so the dock never sampled the
// oscillator at all.
//
// `face-analogVco-compact` now carries the repo's ONE sanctioned treatment for
// a live surface — a `VRT_LIVE_SURFACES` entry (mask + MEASURED companion +
// per-run negative control), which is what `e2e/vrt/vrt-exemptions.ts` had
// already claimed existed for months while the registry had no such key. The
// mask deletes the glyph from the pixel diff; the companion asserts the glyph
// still renders a real moving trace, and the seam's negative control proves on
// every run that the companion can fail. The rest of the tile — the two curated
// knobs, the RACKLINE frame, every label — stays strict.
//
// The face itself is unchanged from the verified batch-3 authoring, and its two
// live defects were fixed independently before it landed: the card/def bipolar
// range disagreement (#1311) and the impossible `pw`-with-an-LFO doc (897b6515).

/**
 * The legacy-fallback MIGRATION derivation: is this module type MIGRATED to a
 * curated ModuleShell face? Drives the workflow `flowNodes` swap (migrated →
 * ModuleShell curated face; un-migrated → styled placeholder + legacy card in
 * the dock). The bridge and the face-lint gate read the SAME set, so a module is
 * "migrated" exactly when it's on the curation bar.
 *
 * A module is only truly migrated once it is BOTH faced AND promoted, so this
 * keys off STRICT_FACES membership (an authored-but-unpromoted `face` is a
 * draft-in-progress, not a shipped face). Pure — no registry read; the caller
 * already has the type. The bridge itself is wired in a later phase (P0.3 / P1).
