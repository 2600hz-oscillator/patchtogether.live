  // The LINES dock full-view body: the live grating picture plus the SCREEN
  // ON/OFF switch the 2026-08-18 owner ruling requires of every video module.
  //
  // ⚠ THE SCREEN SWITCH IS AN ADDITION HERE, NOT A PORT — and saying so is the
  // point, because the reverse (a promotion that silently DELETES a card
  // affordance) is the #1928 defect this slot exists to prevent. `LinesCard.svelte`
  // has no preview canvas and no `previewCollapsed` key at all; it is a flat fader
  // card. So nothing is lost by promotion, and this face GAINS a control its card
  // never had, because the ruling is that every video face ships one and
  // `video-face-screen-source.test.ts` denies a faced video module without it.
  // Recorded so the next reader does not "restore parity" by deleting it.
  //
  // The shape below is `FourPlexVidOutputBody`'s deliberately: same key, same
  // overlay geometry, same watch-mark handling. Copying it is the point — a
  // second spelling of `previewCollapsed` is how these fork.
  //
  // The LANE tile is untouched: `dockFullViewHeadPlan` renders this slot at the
  // dock only, and the lane keeps the generic `VideoTileThumb`.

  // ⚠ SCREEN OFF STOPS THE COPY AND KEEPS THE WATCH MARK (#1937 / #2015).
  // `blitOutputForPreview` IS the engine's "someone is watching" signal — it
  // calls `markWatched` itself, after the gate, because "a refused frame is not
  // an observation" — and a node is a pull root only while that mark is younger
  // than `WATCH_TTL_MS = 1500`. A collapsed state that merely stopped blitting
  // would stop renewing the mark, and the switch would become a PRODUCER KILL
  // SWITCH wherever nothing downstream is watching. That is the live defect
  // #2015 reports against `spirographs`, and the ruling says the module KEEPS
  // RENDERING.
  //
  // ⚠ THE REASON HERE IS THE OUTPUT, NOT AN ACCUMULATOR, and the two arguments
  // are worth keeping apart. `grainsOfVision` and `bentbox` argue from
  // ACCUMULATED STATE (a history ring, a feedback ping-pong) that empties if the
  // node stops being pulled. LINES HAS NO ACCUMULATOR either — no ping-pong, no
  // history, no RNG — so nothing DECAYS while the screen is off.
  //
  // ⚠ BUT IT IS NOT STATELESS THE WAY ITS SIBLINGS ARE, AND THAT IS THE POINT
  // HERE. Its shader reads a TIME term: the def's own prose says the pattern
  // "auto-scrolls on its own (Phase advances steadily over time, time * 0.15
  // wrapped to 0..1) so it is visibly alive without touching a knob". So LINES
  // is a SOURCE that genuinely animates at rest, and a stalled pull does not
  // merely pause a preview — it freezes a moving picture that everything
  // downstream is sampling. That is closer to `inwards` (the other animating
  // generator in this fleet) than to the stateless keyers, and it is why the
  // mark is retained rather than dropped as ceremony. What it protects is the
  // OUTPUT: `out` is mono-video feeding a COLORIZER, a mixer or an OUTPUT, and
  // a control labelled SCREEN must not quietly become a FREEZE for them.
